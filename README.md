# quiz-code-codypolland
## Description

My main focus of this project was to expand my knowledge of Web APIS. I wanted to secure my fondation knowledge of the DOM, setting attributes, creating and apending elements, time intervals, event listeners, and local sotrage. 
I wanted something that I could plug and question in the JavaScript and test my knowledge to further my learning. I too it to the next level and added some custom CSS and fonts to make look polished.
